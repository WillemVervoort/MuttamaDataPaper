abstract: |
  Dryland salinity remains a major natural resource management concern, specifcially in Australia, but also globally. However, a lack of detailed space-time data sets with observations of stream and groundwater salinity has limited further understanding of the range of processes that can lead to dryland salinity problems in landscapes. The aim of this study is to report on the open data available as a result of a 10-year data collection effort in a subcatchment of the Murrumbidgee catchment in New South Wales, Australia. 
  Over a 10 year period a series of different sampling campaigns has resulted in a large dataset with hydrogeochemical data which includes both in-situ (field) data and post laboratory analysis of major anions and cations. The data set covers 23 groundwater sample sites and 37 surface water sites. Because the data was collected by four distinct groups and over many years we analyse if this has caused a bias in the dataset. In addition we show the major spatial and temporal trends to provide an overview of the dataset and analyse any posible biases.
  The dataset is made open access to encourage further research and the basic description already shows the richness of the collected data and opportunities for further research.

\introduction

<!--setting the scene-->
Dryland and irrigation salinity has long been a major natural resource management concern in Australia [@Jolly2001; @White2009; @Scanlon2007; @Walker2002; @Finlayson2010]. The success of management of salinity, while extensively documented, has remained patchy [@Leblanc2012]. As a result, the volume of research and number of publications in this area has decreased significantly in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:SalinityPapers}). This is partly due to the effect of the millenium drought on groundwater levels and consequently salinity [@Mcfarlane2016], but this is also because of the increased understanding that salinity processes can vary substantially  across the landscape [@Conyers2008] and that the processes of salt delivery to the stream also varies in the landscape [@Summerell2006; @Hughes2007] and is dependent on landscape characteristics [@vanDijk2008; @Dalhaus2010].

```


The poor spatial and timescale distribution of water quality datasets has long been an obstacle to measuring trends in salinity. Studies such as Jolly et. al. [-@Jolly2001] and White et. al [-@White2009] used large historical datasets to detect broadscale trends over large periods throughout the Murray Darling Basin (MDB). This work identified that southern and eastern dryland region in the Murray Darling Basin have rising salinity trends that were worse in areas of low rainfall [@White2009; @Jolly2001]. However, the ion composition varied greatly throughout the MDB [@White2009]. More specifically, Conyers et al. [-@Conyers2008] tried to isolate which areas of land in the Murrumbidgee catchment acted as sources of salinity, as well as whether this was predominantly marine cyclic salts (NaCl) as previously assumed, or whether salts from mineral weathering were also involved (e.g. Ca, Mg, HCO~3~). While both can be measured using conventional methods such as EC, a rise in marine cyclic salts can be a major source of osmotic stress, whereas mineral weathering salts are far less harmful and more likely to precipitate at reasonably low concentrations [@Conyers2008]. The ratio of Cl:HCO~3~ ions was identified as the best indicator of the source of salinity, with Cl^-^ acting as a measure of marine cyclic salts and HCO~3~^-^ acting as a measure of mineral weathering salts. The Muttama catchment was specifically identified as a candidate for future research as ion concentrations appeared to change from east to west, correlating with the underlaying mineral types. 


<!-- defining the need for detailed data -->
It is clear from these examples that detailed spatial and temporal datasets are key to understanding different hydrogeochemical processes in the landscape [e.g. @Cartwright2010; @Dalhaus2010], but overall publicly available datasets on dryland salinity in Australia remain limited to detailed data from small experimental catchments (< 100 ha) [@Summerell2006; @Hughes2007] or sparse government datasets from official monitoring (i.e. [https://realtimedata.waternsw.com.au](https://realtimedata.waternsw.com.au) which tend to be limited in hydrogeochemical data. Part of this is related to the sensitivity of the data given the relationship with possible land values. However, as the understanding of salinity occurrence grows this argument is less valid. In fact, making data more widely available would increase the opportunities for research and increase our understanding of dryland salinity processes.Focusing on a smaller catchment in greater detail creates opportunities to test whether sources of salinity can be traced back to specific areas of land.

<!--Some examples of spatial sampling-->
Without regular and expensive automated sampling, field campaigns to collect water quality data tend to be "snapshot" activities [@Grayson1997; @Breuer2015; @Lyon2008; @Cartwright2010] which can be biased due to the over representation of low flow conditions [@Lessels2020]. This means that overall there are limited streamflow and groundwater salinity data sets that combine multiple locations across a significant time period and that combine a range of flow characteristics.


<!--aims-->
The aim of this paper is to present and describe the space time dimensions and relationships of a complex groundwater and surface water hydrogeochemistry dataset that was collected over a 10 year period in a 1000km^2^ agricultural catchment in New South Wales, Australia. This paper only gives a broad description of the dataset to facilitate open access of the dataset, but does not analyse the physicochemical relationships in the data in detail. This will be analysed in follow-up papers. The main aim of this paper is to make the data set accessible to other researchers to encourage further research in this catchment.

# Methods

## Muttama catchment

Muttama creek sub-catchment (Figure \ref{fig:samplemap}) is located in the Mid-Murrumbidgee catchment area of NSW in south eastern Australia. The landscape is undulating with only limited elevation variations (227 - 719 m). Muttama creek flows north-south through the length of the catchment towards the Murrumbidgee River near Gundagai. The main township,  Cootamundra is located in the upper half of the catchment. The dominant land use type of this catchment is about 93% agriculture, dominated by winter-spring cropping and pasture . Mean annual rainfall (1891-2017) in the catchment is 653 mm for the Bureau of Meteorology Landgrove station (073022).

knitr::include_graphics("../Muttama Dataset analysis- Mina/maps/gw_or_sw_map.png")
#Muttama_maps.rmd
```


The depth to the nearest groundwater table varies across the Muttama catchment and it ranges from < 2m to 20m below ground level [@DECC2009]. Deep groundwater in the catchment area occurs mostly in fractured rock aquifers common on the eastern, and western fringes of the catchment. In contrast shallow groundwater is associated with unconfined alluvial, colluvial, and eluvial aquifers. Some aquifers in the northern part of this catchment show artesian behavior [@Webb1999; @Akter2018]. 

Saline areas of this catchment tend to be associated with geological heterogeneity, primarily the sedimentary materials in the west and rhyolite on the northwest side [@Conyers2008]. Overall, Muttama creek is a significant salt contributor to the downstream Murrumbidgee river with around 58% from cyclic sources and 42% salts originating from mineral weathering [@Conyers2008]. 

## Data Collection

### Data Sources

The dataset contains data from 4 main sampling sources  related to four distinct groups of “people” doing the sample collection. The term “people” is used here loosely, as it mainly related to four different types of sampling campaigns, which potentially had differences in the rigour of the sampling campaign (Quality control, types of samples taken, training of the people taking the samples). These groups are designated as: 

-	Source 1: Data from the PhD study by Akter [-@Akter2018]. 

-	Source 2: Data from the sampling campaign of two former students, the PhD from Lessels [-@Lessels2014]   and unpublished data from another student, E. Milne.

-	Source 3: A dataset collected by undergraduate and postgraduate students as part of field trips in different units of study at the University of Sydney is identified as “Student data”. This data was sampled “ad-hoc” during the field trip period using standard sampling protocols as described for the data from Akter [-@Akter2018].  

- Source 4: Data from several autosamplers installed in the catchment during the PhD from Lessels [-@Lessels2014]. Because these samples were not taken by a "person" and were taken on a flow weigthed basis, we separated the data from the "grab" samples in the other methods.

Overall, 1087 samples were collected from 60 sample locations were sampled over the 2010 - 2020 period. However, not all sites were sampled at all times and not all samples were fully analysed for all hydrogeochmical variables. Both surface water and groundwater samples were collected (23 groundwater sample sites and 37 surface water sites) distributed across the catchment, depending on standing water availability and access.

### Variables

The overall structure of the dataset consists of repeated measurements over time at multiple locations in Muttama catchment. For each location the name of the location and the spatial coordinates were recorded in decimal degrees (Longitude = x and Latitude = y) as well as whether the location was a groundwater or a surface water location. The names of the locations are fairly random and basic locality indicators, which cannot be interpreted exactly.

The measurements in time consist of up to six variables which were measured in the field (Table \ref{tab:TableMeasurements}). These were complemented by laboratory analysis, which repeated some of the field measurements, and for an additional 15 anion and cation variables.

\clearpage
```{r TableMeasurements, echo=F, warning=F, include=T, message=F}
field<-c('pH','EC (Electrical conductivity)', 'SPC (temperature corrected EC)', 'Temperature', 'Alkalinity (HCO3)', 'Dissolved Oxygen (DO)', 'Turbidity')
lab<-read_csv('lab.csv')
table_M <- tibble(`Field measurements` = c(field,rep(NA,2)), 
                  `Lab repeat` = c(unlist(lab[1:3,1]), rep(NA,6)),
                  `Anions` = c(unlist(lab[4:9,1]),rep(NA,3)),
                  `Cations` = unlist(lab[,2]))
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
knitr::kable(table_M, "latex", caption = "Variables measured in the field and laboratory") %>% kable_styling()

```

The variables pH, EC, SPC, Temperature, and in some cases DO and Turbidity were measured using a range of field probes. All field probes measured pH, EC, Temperature and calculated SPC. Early measurements used a YSI probe that included a turbidity and DO probe (YSI 6600 and YSI 600 for surface and groundwater, respectively). Later groundwater samples used a different YSI probe (YSI ProPlus multi-parameter) that only included a DO probe. Later surface water sampling used a Xylem EXO probe which also included DO and turbidity.

Anions in most of the samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography method (Dionex P680 HPLC) and cations were measured on acidified samples using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, Varian 720-ES) at the University of Sydney [@Akter2018]. Duplicate samples in the analysis had a reported relative percentage difference (RPD) lower than 5% in part of the sample dataset [@Akter2018]. Some of the samples in the undergraduate student sample set (Source 3) were analysed by a commercial laboratory ([ALS Environmental, Smithfield, NSW](https://www.alsglobal.com/en/locations/asia-pacific/pacific/australia/nsw/sydney-woodpark-environmental)). Alkalinity concentrations were measured in the field within 24h of collection using a HACH digital titrator (model 16900) [@Akter2018]. 

Using the cation and anion data, ion balances were calculated from samples which had a complete set of anion and cation measurements. 

## Boxplots and maps

Using the most complete data, boxplots and spatial maps were generated to highlight the spatial and temporal variation in the data set. As this paper is mainly focused on describing the dataset, we chose to use boxplots to visually highlight statistical differences between data variables rather than using full statistical analysis.

The mean concentration and interquartile range (25th - 75th percentile) of the concentration data distributions were calculated to give an indication of variance of the data in the spatial maps.

All graphs and maps were produced using R [@R2020]. All code can be found in the supplementary data. <!-- change this to a github repos in the end? -->
 
## Principal component analysis

To illustrate relationships determining the overall variation in the data set Principal Component Analysis [@Manly1944] was used. Included in the analysis were the Latitude (x) and Longitude (y), as well as the monthly rainfall, the season (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and whether the sample was taken from groundwater or surface water (gw_or_sw). The PCA plot will indicate those variables that explain the greatest variation in the dataset, and whether variables in the dataset are correlated. The seasonality and the monthly rainfall were included to incorporate a time dimensions, while the x and y variables describe the spatial dimension of the variables.

## GAM Analysis

To provide a bt more detail in the temporal analysis, and in particular to capture the temporal variability in some of the variables, we applied Generalised Additive Models [@Wood2006] in R. Most models were first analysed using a GAM, and subsequently using a GAMM (Generalised Additive Mixed Model) to remove the effect of time autocorrelation (for time and rainfall variables) in the residuals. Log transformation of variables was generally used to increase normality (**see code in supplementary data**). The smoothness (k) of the splines in the GAM and GAMM were limited to 3 to reduce overfitting in the GAM models. The following GAM and GAMM were analysed:

- The impact of of multiple space and time variables (rainfall, water source, time, seasonality) on EC, pH, Cl:HCO3 ratio and nitrates . These variables were selected based on their importance in describing salinity processes in the catchment as well as the completeness within the dataset.

- Effect of water source (groundwater or surface water) and spatial variation (using coordinates) on pH, EC and Cl:HCO3 ratio

```

Data source 3 was the most complete in terms of variables analysed, because in this set more variables were analysed in the commercial lab (Fig \ref{fig:na-plot}). Some of the variables analysed in the commercial lab were not analysed with the equipment at the University of Sydney. However, source 3 had the smallest number of overall samples. Source 2 has the most incomplete data points. Source 4 has a very consistent number of missing values, possibly because not all samples were analysed in the set. For source 2, the missing data suggests that for many of the samples only a few of the variables were measured and some of the other variables were simply not analysed as highlighted above. In the data from source 2, almost  50% of samples are incomplete in terms of the measurement of all the variables in Table 2. Similarly, source 1 had more incomplete data, because some of the minor elements were not analysed.  The field recorded variables pH, EC, SPC and Temperature were the most complete as they were generally measured directly in the field. Analysis of bicarbonate in the field only started around 2014. Thus the distribution of the NA values in the overall dataset is mostly a reflection of the time period of sampling and the change in methodology over the ten years of sampling.

### Groundwater vs Surfacewater

#Muttama_NA_count
```

Groundwater samples have quite a distinctive signature compared to the surface water samples (Fig \ref{fig:gw_sw-plot}). For example, groundwater samples tend to be higher in EC and  lower in pH compared to surface water samples. Since 'Source 1' collected most of the groundwater samples, this results in differences between data collection sources. Field SPC measurements were used to represent EC since these samples had the best coverage.

\clearpage
```{r gw_sw-plot, warning=FALSE, echo=F, fig.cap = "Difference in pH and EC for groundwater and surface water samples. The source of the data (the samping group) is indicated with colour", out.width="80%"}

``` 



## Temporal Distribution of Data

\clearpage
```{r month-plot, warning=FALSE, echo=F, fig.cap = "Distribution of samples throughout the year (total number of samples collected during each month) against average monthly rainfall during the study period. ", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../Muttama Dataset analysis- Mina/maps/monthly.png")

#Muttama_Time.rmd
```

Overall the sampling appears to have a reasonable distribution across all months (Fig \ref{fig:month-plot}), so any seasonal trends should be identifiable in the data the data. Average rainfall data (2010-2020) does not indicate any major seasonal trends, although there is a slight dominance of rainfall in early Spring. This also explains the higher number of samples in this period because, we would organise more sampling trips in this period, and spatially more channels could be sampled for surface water. The timing of Source 3, (the student data) is a clear effect of yearly field trips, which tended to occur at approximately the same time of the year.

\clearpage
```{r annual-plot, warning=FALSE, echo=F, fig.cap = "Distribution of samples over the study period (total number of samples collected during each year) against average monthly rainfall during the study period. ", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../Muttama Dataset analysis- Mina/maps/yearly.png")

#Muttama_Time.rmd
```

The number of samples collected in each year in relation to the sources changes significantly through the years reflecting the duration of the different studies and funding cycles (Fig \ref{fig:annual-plot}); however the data is still well-distributed enough that overall trends should be clear. In addition, some of the sample volumes can be related to the occurrence of rainfall, as in drier years several of the channels would be dry and no sampling of surface water could occur. 

Consistent groundwater sampling commenced later in the project, which means that there are very few groundwater samples before 2013. In contrast, the autosamplers were installed early in the project and there are no samples from this source after 2013. 

\clearpage
```{r FDC, warning=FALSE, echo=F, fig.cap = "Sample distribution on flow duration curve derived from flow data from Coolac autosampler.", fig.show="hold", out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../Muttama Dataset analysis- Mina/maps/FDC.png")

#Muttama_FDC.rmd
```
Surface water samples were reasonably well distributed across the flow duration curve, however there is a clear bias towards periods of medium flow. This is most likely since many of the surface water sampling points are often completely dry during periods of low flow, and therefore cannot be sampled. In addition, there are no samples during high or very high flow as during flood situations sampling was dangerous and restricted by work health and safety considerations.

## Spatial variation

\clearpage
```{r ECmap, warning=FALSE, echo=F, fig.cap = "Spatial Variation of EC throughout the catchment, using Mean EC for each sampling location", fid.show='hold',out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../Muttama Dataset analysis- Mina/maps/ec_map.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../Muttama Dataset analysis- Mina/maps/ec_plot.png")

#Muttama_maps.rmd
```

\clearpage
```{r Carbonate-map, warning=FALSE, echo=F, fig.cap = "Spatial Variation of Cl:HCO3 ratio throughout the catchment, using Mean for each sampling location.", fig.show="hold", out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../Muttama Dataset analysis- Mina/maps/clhco3_plot.png")

#Muttama_maps.rmd
```

There is clear spatial variation in water parameters throughout the catchment, including between groundwater and surface water sampling sites (Figures \ref{fig:ECmap} and \ref{fig:Carbonate-map}). As examples, the spatial distributions for EC and Cl:HCO~3~ are shown, however similar maps can be easily generated for other parameters using the code in the supplementary material. In the map, the concentration is indicated by the size of the symbol, while the colour shading indicates the variability. This suggests surface water samples had lower variability and lower concentrations. Below the map, a boxplot further indicates the difference between the distributions from the surface water sample sites and the groundwater sample sites, and indicates the difference between sample sites. 

Previous studies have suggested there may be a difference in Cl:HCO~3~ ratio in surface water between the eastern and western parts of the Muttama catchment [@Conyers2008], however it is difficult to see whether this pattern occurs based on the spatial maps. This partly has to do with the limitations in the spatial sampling, which relied on existing groundwater tube wells and accessible stream points.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

\clearpage
```{r PCA-plot, warning=FALSE, echo=F, fig.cap = "PCA Biplot with some variables removed to improve dataset (reduce NA values)", out.width="70%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../Muttama Dataset analysis- Mina/maps/pca_biplot.png")


#Muttama_pca.rmd
```

The results of the PCA (Fig \ref{fig:PCA-plot}) highlights that location is the most important determinant of the characteristics of a sample. Coordinates and groundwater or surface water parameter therefore  explain a lot of variation. Rainfall and Seasons do not appear to have much effect, suggesting that the variation in time is less than the variation is space. This could be partly because we have lumped groundwater and surface water samples together, and the variation in the surface water samples is masked by the more stationary nature of the groundwater concentrations. 

Most salt species are grouped together, apart from potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), nitrates (NO~3~) and bicarbonates (HCO~3~). This suggests that these variables (K, Mg, NO~3~ and HCO~3~) are the main parameters that will separate the samples. Given that HCO~3~ and Mg are negatively correlated with the gw_or_sw variable, this suggests that groundwater samples are higher in Mg and HCO~3~ compared to surface water samples. In contrast NO~3~ and K are associated with the spatial variable x and y, thus suggesting some spatial pattern in the samples.

## Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and Generalised Additive Mixed Models

### EC

As highlighted in the methods, intially, the following GAM model was fitted to the EC data:

$log(spc\_field) = Time + s(Month,k=3) + s(Rainfall,k=3) + s(x,k=3) + s(y,k=3) + gw\_or\_sw + \epsilon$

Note that the flexibility of the smooths is constrained to 3 knots to prevent overfitting. Because the GAM does not take into account the autocorrelation in the residuals, we also fitted a similar GAMM, which only differs in considering first order autocorrelated errors ($\epsilon$)

$log(spc\_field) = Time + s(Month,k=3) + s(Rainfall,k=3) + s(x,k=3) + s(y,k=3) + gw\_or\_sw + corAR1(\epsilon)$

Using the field measured, temperature corrected, EC as a predictant in a GAM model results in a model that explains 56.9% of the variability in the data. This model indicated that seasonality was a significant predictor.
In contrast, the mixed model (GAMM), which  accounts for the autocorrelation in the residuals, accounted for 59.6% of the variation, but seasonality no longer had a significant effect (Fig \ref{fig:ec_gamm-plot}). This suggests that the seasonality mainly introduces autocorrelation in the data and thus there is a smooth change in EC from season to season. Rainfall and gw_or_sw were found to be significant in all models, with the latter confirming the difference between groundwater and surface water observed in Fig \ref{fig:gw_sw-plot}. Interestingly, EC decreased significantly moving from West to East, possibly aligned with the earlier observation on the Cl:HCO~3~ trends observed by @Conyers2008. North to South variation was not as significant, however EC appeared to be slightly higher in the middle of the catchment, which is also visible in Fig \ref{fig:ECmap}. 
See supplementary materials for the model details.

### Cl:HCO~3~ Ratio

Similar to the EC values the GAM (generalised additive model) for the Cl:HCO~3~ ratio was defined as:

$log(Cl/HCO_3) = Time + s(Month,k=3) + s(Rainfall,k=3) + s(x,k=3) + s(y,k=3) + gw\_or\_sw + \epsilon$

p-values of the Cl:HCO~3~ GAMM model coefficients  

$log(Cl/HCO_3) = Time + s(Month,k=3) + s(Rainfall,k=3) + s(x,k=3) + s(y,k=3) + gw\_or\_sw + corAR1(\epsilon)$



```{r TableCLHCO3GAM, echo=F, warning=F, include=T, message=F}
Coef<-c('Time (Month,Year)','gw_or_sw','Month (smooth)','Rainfall (smooth)','Longitude (x (smooth))','Latitude (y (smooth))')

table_M <- tibble("Model Coefficients" = Coef,
                `P-value` = round(c(as.numeric(summary(gamm4_mod$gam)[[4]])[2:3],
                                as.numeric(summary(gamm4_mod$gam)[[8]])),2))

Similar to the EC data, the Cl:HCO~3~ ratio appears to not be significantly affected by seasonality when accounting for the autocorrelation in a GAMM model (\ref{fig:CLCarbonate-gammplot}). However, there was no relationship with rainfall, but the ratio is significantly higher in groundwater than surface water, confirming earlier results. Spatially, the sample data set suggests that the ratio appears to significantly decrease moving southeast. 

# Discussion

## Data quality

Having different people and different groups sample across 10 years with a varying group of instruments can create difficulties in relation to managing data quality. While there is a noticeable difference in sample completeness between the sample sources (Fig \ref{fig:na-plot}), this does not appear to be affect the quality of the data from the different data sources. From all the variables pH, EC and temperature were the most complete (least number of NA values) measurements within the dataset between all sources. 

At first glance, there do appear to be major differences in average values between the data sources, but most of this can be accounted for when differences in sample sites are considered. While Source 1 contains a large amount of groundwater data, Source 2 is mostly surface water data. When separated by groundwater/surface water, all sources appear to have similar distributions. Overall, we can assume that although there are differences in spatial and temporal distribution between the sources that the overall quality of the data collected is reasonably high and suitable for analysis. 

## Space Time distribution

While there are some trends in the monthly distribution of data (mostly relating to the timing of student field trips), the data is well distributed enough that any seasonal trends should be visible. Furthermore, while the overall time distribution of the data has some inconsistency, it is well spaced enough that long term trends in salt balances should be visible. 

## Spatial distribution

Sampling points were well spread out over the whole catchment, and generally follow the north-to-south topography of Muttama catchment. We are particularly interested in differences between the east and west halves of the catchment, as previous studies have suggested that differences in mineralogy may lead to different sources of salt (reference). We can assume that the sampling design is sufficient to pick up on these trends.

## PCA

The PCA suggests there is a spatial distribution of salt sources throughout the catchment. Many salts of common origins are clustered together around dimension 1. The GW/SW parameter also appears to have a significant effect on other measurements, most likely due to groundwater sources having higher mineral concentrations.

Coordinates appear to be very significant, though this may just be an effect of the general spatial distribution of the datapoints, rather than a catchment-wide trend in mineralogy.

Rainfall does not appear to be a significant predictor of variability, which is likely due to the relatively consistent rainfall pattern throughout the year. There are four ions which stand out from the other salts, and as such may be a result of different sources. These are potassium, nitrate, carbonate and magnesium. In particular, potassium and nitrate appear to be highly correlated to coordinates, which suggests a high degree of spatial correlation. 


\conclusions

This paper reports on a long term (10 year) hydrogeochemistry dataset from a single catchment in NSW, Australia. This dataset includes both groundwater and surface water samples for over 20 locations within the catchment. While the dataset was collected by different groups of people at different times and location, it still provides a valuable long term and spatially diverse data set which can be used for research into the space and time variation in dryland and groundwater salinity.
