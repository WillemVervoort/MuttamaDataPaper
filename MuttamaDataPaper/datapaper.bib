   abstract = {Abstract This study uses water-quality data collected over 20 years, from 102 predominantly rural sites across Victoria, Australia, to further our understanding of spatial variability in riverine water quality. We focus on concentrations of total suspended solids, total phosphorus, filterable reactive phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, nitrate/nitrite (NOx), and electrical conductivity. We used an exhaustive search approach to identify the linear models that best link catchment characteristics to time-averaged constituent concentrations. We ran additional analyses to (1) assess the performance of these models under drought conditions, and (2) understand the key drivers of site-level variability (standard deviations) of constituent concentrations. Natural catchment characteristics appear to have a greater effect on spatial differences in average constituent concentrations. Performance of the statistical models of time-averaged constituent concentrations varied, and spatial variability in mean electrical conductivity levels could be more readily explained by catchment characteristics compared to more reactive nutrients. Notwithstanding, the models performed relatively well under varying hydrologic conditions for most constituents. As such, these models provide an insight into the key factors affecting spatial variability in average stream water-quality conditions. We also identified that hydrologic, climatic, and topographic characteristics of the catchment helped explain the spatial variability in temporal changes in constituents. After calibration and validation, these models of both average water quality and variability in water quality could be used to forecast stream water-quality responses to future land use, climate, or soil and land management changes.},

   abstract = {Soil salinization resulting from shallow saline groundwater is a major global environmental issue causing land degradation, especially in semi-arid regions such as Australia. The adverse impact of shallow saline groundwater on soil salinization varies in space and time due to the variation in groundwater levels and salt concentration. Understanding the spatio-temporal variation is therefore vital to develop an effective salinity management strategy. In New South Wales, Australia, a hydrogeological landscape unit approach is generally applied, based on spatial information and expert operators, classifying the landscape in relation to landscape and climate. In this paper, a data science approach (random forest model) is introduced, based on historical groundwater quality and quantity data providing predictions in a 4-dimensional space. As a case study, we demonstrate the spatio-temporal factors impacting standing water levels (SWL) and associated salinity and predict the spatial and temporal variability in the Muttama catchment (1059 km2), in NSW, south eastern Australia. The random forest model explains 77% of the variance in the groundwater salinity (electrical conductivity) and 65% of the SWL. Spatial factors were the most significant variables determining the space-time variation in groundwater salinity and the occurrence of groundwater at the surface. Drilled piezometer depth and elevation are dominant factors controlling SWL, while salinity is mainly determined by underlying geology. The methodology in this study predicts salinity and SWL in the landscape at fine scales, through time, improving options for salinity management.},

Although monitoring of salinity is relatively common compared to many other water quality parameters, no compilation and harmonisation of available datasets for both surface and groundwater components have been made yet at the global scale. Here, we present a new global salinity database, compiled from electrical conductivity (EC) monitoring data of both surface water (rivers, lakes/reservoirs) and groundwater locations over the period 1980–2019. The data were assembled from a range of sources, including local to global salinity databases, governmental organizations, river basin management commissions and water development boards. Our resulting database comprises more than 16.3 million measurements from 45,103 surface water locations and 208,550 groundwater locations around the world. This database could provide new opportunities for meta-analyses of salinity levels of water resources, as well as for addressing data and model-driven questions related to historic and future salinization patterns and impacts.},

   abstract = {Soil salinization and sodification are common processes that particularly characterize drylands. These processes can be attributed either to natural conditions or anthropogenic activities. While natural causes include factors such as climate, lithology, topography, and pedology, human causes are mostly related to agricultural land-use, and specifically, to irrigated agriculture. The objective of this study was to thoroughly review this topic, while highlighting the major challenges and related opportunities. Over time, the extent of saline, sodic, and saline-sodic croplands has increased, resulting in accelerated land degradation and desertification, decreased agricultural productivity, and consequently jeopardizing environmental and food security. Mapping and monitoring saline soils is an important management tool, aimed at determining the extent and severity of salinization processes. Recent developments in advanced remote sensing methods have improved the efficacy of mapping and monitoring saline soils. Knowledge on prevention, mitigation, and recovery of soil salinity and sodicity has substantially grown over time. This knowledge includes advanced measures for salt flushing and leaching, water-saving irrigation technologies, precision fertilizer systems, chemical restoration, organic and microbial remediation, and phytoremediation of affected lands. Of a particular interest is the development of forestry-related means, with afforestation, reforestation, agroforestry, and silvopasture practices for the recovery of salt-affected soils. The forecasted expansion of drylands and aggravated drying of existing drylands due to climatic change emphasize the importance of this topic.},

Increasing salinity can have adverse effects on human health (1); increase the costs of water treatment for human consumption; and damage infrastructure [e.g., amounting to $700 million per year in the Border Rivers catchment, Australia (2)]. It can also reduce freshwater biodiversity (3); alter ecosystem functions (4); and affect economic well-being by altering ecosystem goods and services (e.g., fisheries collapse). Yet water-quality legislation and regulations that target salinity typically focus on drinking water and irrigation water, which does not automatically protect biodiversity. For example, specific electrical conductivities (a proxy for salinity) of 2 mS/cm can be acceptable for drinking and irrigation but could extirpate many freshwater insect species (3). We argue that salinity standards for specific ions and ion mixtures, not just for total salinity, should be developed and legally enforced to protect freshwater life and ecosystem services. We identify barriers to setting such standards and recommend management guidelines.},

The solution is seen as a move away from traditional agricultural practices which are inefficient water users and lead to high groundwater recharge and toward high water use enterprises that can minimise groundwater recharge. Previous modelling studies have shown that land use change in local groundwater systems has the potential to impact upon groundwater levels and streamflow within a decadal scale time frame, however there are few field based studies to prove the modelling correct. The current study reports on 13 years of groundwater and surface water monitoring on a 129 ha first order catchment in the Boorowa River catchment in NSW, Australia. The land use has changed from annual cropping and pastures to tree belts with perennial pastures. Five years after the land use change, the groundwater levels have fallen dramatically due to almost no recharge, runoff has been significantly reduced and the salt input–output ratio of the catchment has halved. Analysis of the measured components of the water cycle show that the reduction in recharge and runoff are due to the land use change and not merely a reflection of the reduced rainfall since the implementation of the land use change. Numerical groundwater modelling has shown that the reduction in salt affected area in this catchment and the export of salt out of this catchment will reduce for the next few decades.},

   abstract = {Summary Stream salinity is a major concern in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) for its impact upon irrigation, urban water supplies and biota. This study investigated the source of salt to a perennial stream in a small salt affected catchment in the eastern MDB. Using a Bayesian mixing model on an event basis, it was found that between one third and two thirds of the salt came from the near surface zone (0-0.2 m) and the remainder came from groundwater. For the year 2006, 38% of the salt exported from the catchment was sourced from the near surface zone. The source of water for the near surface zone comprises less than 1% of the catchment area and is associated with a saline seep/scald. This area becomes saturated during the winter months when saturated overland flow is generated. This mechanism for salt delivery to a stream is not explicitly included in most models used to generate management scenarios for the mitigation of stream salinity. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the near surface zone is very important for salt delivery to streams, therefore models should explicitly incorporate this mechanism.},

   journal = {Journal of Hydrology},
   volume = {571},
   pages = {749-764},
   abstract = {Arid and semi-arid regions experience large hydroclimatic variability and decadal-scale droughts. During droughts, the reduced water availability alters the biophysical properties of the catchments which leads to non-stationarity in rainfall-runoff (r-r) relationships. Uncertainty exists regarding the mechanisms causing r-r non-stationarity, especially at seasonal scales. This study analyses endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms which could possibly influence r-r relationships in two case study catchments in southeast Australia (SEA). The case study catchments are chosen such that they are representative of arid to semi-arid catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal-scale droughts. The results demonstrate that endogenous catchment mechanisms (i.e. groundwater table, baseflow and vegetation) have stronger influences on non-stationarity in r-r relationships than exogenous catchment mechanisms like temperature and potential evapotranspiration. These findings highlight the importance of understanding changes in r-r relationships in order to develop more realistic and reliable hydrological models that are needed to quantify and adapt to the impacts of changing catchment or hydroclimatic conditions. While this study is focussed on SEA the findings are relevant to all catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal-scale droughts.},
