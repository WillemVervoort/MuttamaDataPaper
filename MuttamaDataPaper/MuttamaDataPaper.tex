\begin{abstract}
Dryland salinity remains a major global natural resource management
concern, and specifcially in Australia. However, limited detailed
space-time data sets with observations of stream and groundwater
salinity has constrained a deep understanding of the range of processes
that can lead to dryland salinity problems in landscapes. The aim of
this study is to report on the open data set resulting from a 12-year
data collection effort in a subcatchment of the Murrumbidgee catchment
in New South Wales, Australia. Over a 12 year period a series of
different sampling campaigns has resulted in a large dataset with
hydrogeochemical data which includes both in-situ (field) data and post
laboratory analysis of major anions and cations. This augmented by
observed groundwater levels and publicly available streamflow and
climate data. The data set covers 23 groundwater sample sites and 37
surface water sites. Because the data was collected by four distinct
groups and over many years we analyse if this has caused a bias in the
dataset. In addition we show the major spatial and temporal trends to
provide an overview of the dataset and highlight any posible biases. The
dataset is made open access to encourage further research and the
current paper shows the richness of the collected data and opportunities
for further research.

\section{Introduction}

Dryland and irrigation salinity has long been a major natural resource
management concern in Australia
\citep{Jolly2001, White2009, Scanlon2007, Walker2002, Finlayson2010}.
Globally, the success of management of salinity, while extensively
documented, has remained patchy \citep{Leblanc2012}. As a result, the
volume of research and number of publications in this area has decreased
significantly in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:SalinityPapers}). In
Australia, this is partly due to the effect of the millenium drought on
groundwater levels and the consequent reduction in the appearance of
salinity effects in the landscape \citep{Mcfarlane2016}. However, the
reduction in research is also because of the increased understanding
that salinity processes are more complex than previously recognised. For
example, salinity processes can vary substantially across the landscape
\citep{Conyers2008} and the processes of salt delivery to the stream
also varies in the landscape \citep{Summerell2006, Hughes2007} and is
dependent on landscape characteristics \citep{vanDijk2008, Dalhaus2010}.
As a result, the investment required to improve the understanding and
increase the effectiveness of management is considerable and this has
limited the number of studies after the large investment in the late
1990s and 2000s.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/Dryland Salinity Papers} \caption{Number of papers on the Web of Science related to the search terms (Dryland Salinity) AND Australia, 1980 - 2022}\label{fig:SalinityPapers}
\end{figure}

The poor spatial and timescale distribution of water quality datasets
has long been an obstacle to measuring trends in salinity. Studies such
as Jolly et. al. \citeyearpar{Jolly2001} and White et. al
\citeyearpar{White2009} used large historical datasets to detect
broadscale trends over large periods throughout the Murray Darling Basin
(MDB). This work identified that southern and eastern dryland regions in
the Murray Darling Basin have rising salinity trends that were worse in
areas of low rainfall \citep{White2009, Jolly2001}. However, the ion
composition varied greatly throughout the MDB \citep{White2009}. More
specifically, Conyers et al. \citeyearpar{Conyers2008} tried to isolate
which areas in the Murrumbidgee catchment acted as sources of salinity,
as well as whether this was predominantly marine cyclic salts (NaCl) as
previously assumed, or whether salts from mineral weathering were also
involved (e.g.~Ca, Mg, HCO\textsubscript{3}). While both can be measured
using conventional methods such as EC, a rise in marine cyclic salts can
be a major source of osmotic stress, whereas mineral weathering salts
are far less harmful and more likely to precipitate at reasonably low
concentrations \citep{Conyers2008}. The ratio of Cl:HCO\textsubscript{3}
ions was identified as the best indicator of the source of salinity,
with Cl\textsuperscript{-} acting as a measure of marine cyclic salts
and HCO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-} acting as a measure of
mineral weathering salts. The Muttama catchment was specifically
identified as a candidate for future research as ion concentrations
appeared to change from east to west, correlating with the underlying
mineral types.

It is clear from these examples that detailed spatial and temporal
datasets are key to understanding different hydrogeochemical processes
in the landscape \citep[e.g.][]{Cartwright2010, Dalhaus2010}, but
overall publicly available datasets on dryland salinity in Australia
remain limited to detailed data from small experimental catchments
(\textless{} 100 ha) \citep{Summerell2006, Hughes2007} or sparse
government datasets from official monitoring
(i.e.~\href{https://waterinsights.waternsw.com.au/}{WaterNSW
WaterInsights platform}) which tend to be limited in hydrogeochemical
data. Part of this is related to the sensitivity of the data given the
relationship with possible land values. However, as the understanding of
salinity occurrence grows, this argument is less valid. Making data more
widely available would increase the opportunities for research and
increase our understanding of dryland salinity processes.

Without regular and expensive automated sampling, field campaigns to
collect water quality data tend to be ``snapshot'' activities
\citep{Grayson1997, Breuer2015, Lyon2008, Cartwright2010, Lintern2018}
which can be biased due to the over representation of low flow
conditions \citep{Lessels2020}. Even the analyses of substantial
government data bases \citep{Lintern2018} are likely to be biased in
this way. This means that overall there are limited streamflow and
groundwater salinity data sets that combine multiple locations across a
significant time period and that combine a range of flow
characteristics.

The aim of this paper is to present and describe the space time
dimensions and basic relationships of a complex groundwater and surface
water hydrogeochemistry dataset that was collected over a 10 year period
in a 1000km\textsuperscript{2} agricultural catchment in New South
Wales, Australia. The Muttama catchment, which is the focus of this
paper, provides a microcosm of groundwater and surface water salinity
variability in Australia. Focusing on a medium size catchment in greater
detail creates opportunities to test whether sources of salinity can be
traced back to specific areas of land.

This paper gives a description of the dataset to facilitate open access
of the dataset, but does not analyse the physiochemical relationships in
the data in detail. This will be analysed in follow-up papers and was
partly analysed in an earlier thesis \citep{Akter2018}. The main aim of
this paper is to make the data set accessible to other researchers to
encourage further research in this catchment and in salinity in general.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Muttama catchment}

Muttama creek catchment (Figure \ref{fig:samplemap}) is located in the
Mid-Murrumbidgee catchment area of NSW in south eastern Australia. The
landscape is undulating with only limited elevation variations (227 -
719 m). Muttama creek flows north-south through the length of the
catchment towards the Murrumbidgee River near Gundagai. The main
township, Cootamundra is located in the upper half of the catchment. The
dominant land use type of this catchment is about 93\% agriculture,
dominated by winter-spring cropping and pasture. Mean annual rainfall
(1891-2024) in the catchment is 654 mm for the longest running Bureau of
Meteorology Landgrove station (station 073022).

Streamflow is measured continuously by WaterNSW, the state agency
responsible for water data collection, at three locations in the
catchment: Coolac, station no. 410044, the main downstream point, and
Berthong, station no. 41000207 and Jindalee, station no. 410112 on two
branches above the Cootamundra township. This data is available as open
access via the \href{https://waterinsights.waternsw.com.au/}{WaterNSW
WaterInsights platform} or through the
\href{http://bom.gov.au/waterdata/}{Bureau of Meteorology}. Here, we
only use the data from the Coolac station as a comparison.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/gw_or_sw_map} \caption{Muttama Catchment Sampling Locations with Elevation. Symbol colour indicates whether location was a groundwater or surface water source, with blue being surface water and brown/orange being groundwater. The numbers on the map represent the sample location number.}\label{fig:samplemap}
\end{figure}

The depth to the nearest groundwater table varies across the Muttama
catchment and it ranges from \textless{} 2m to 20m below ground level
\citep{DECC2009}. Deep groundwater in the catchment occurs mostly in
fractured rock aquifers common on the eastern, and western fringes of
the catchment. In contrast, shallow groundwater is associated with
unconfined alluvial, colluvial, and eluvial aquifers. Some aquifers in
the northern part of this catchment show artesian behavior
\citep{Webb1999, Akter2018}.

Saline areas of the catchment tend to be associated with geological
heterogeneity, primarily the sedimentary materials in the west and
rhyolite on the northwest side \citep{Conyers2008}. Overall, Muttama
creek is a significant salt contributor to the downstream Murrumbidgee
river with suggested contributions of around 58\% from cyclic sources
and 42\% salts originating from mineral weathering \citep{Conyers2008}.

\subsection{Data Collection}

\subsubsection{Data Sources}

The water quality dataset contains data from 4 main sampling sources
related to four distinct groups of ``people'' doing the sample
collection. The term ``people'' is used loosely, as it mainly related to
four different types of sampling campaigns, which potentially had
differences in the rigour of the sampling campaign (Quality control,
types of samples taken, training of the people taking the samples).
These groups are designated as:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Source 1: Data from the PhD study by Akter \citeyearpar{Akter2018}.
\item
  Source 2: Data from the sampling campaign of two former students, the
  PhD from Lessels \citeyearpar{Lessels2014} and unpublished data from
  another student, E. Milne.
\item
  Source 3: A dataset collected by undergraduate and postgraduate
  students as part of field trips in different units of study at the
  University of Sydney is identified as ``Student data''. This data was
  sampled ``ad-hoc'' during the field trip period using standard
  sampling protocols as described for the data from Akter
  \citeyearpar{Akter2018}.
\item
  Source 4: Data from several autosamplers installed in the catchment
  during the PhD from Lessels \citeyearpar{Lessels2014}. Because these
  samples were not taken by a ``person'' and were taken on a flow
  weighted basis, we separated the data from the ``grab'' samples in the
  other methods. These samples are also missing field measurements, as
  these were only analysed in the laboratory.
\end{itemize}

Overall, 1160 water samples were collected from 62 sample locations over
the 2010 - 2024 period. However, not all sites were sampled at all times
and not all samples were fully analysed for all hydrogeochemical
variables. Both surface water and groundwater samples were collected (23
groundwater sample sites and 39 surface water sites) distributed across
the catchment, depending on standing water availability and access.

In addition to the water quality dataset, data from 23 groundwater data
loggers is provided from the same groundwater sample sites as in the
hydrogeochemical dataset.

\subsubsection{Hydrogeochemical Variables}

The overall structure of the hydrogeochemical dataset consists of
repeated measurements over time at multiple locations in Muttama
catchment. For each location the name of the location and the spatial
coordinates were recorded in decimal degrees (Longitude = x and Latitude
= y) as well as whether the location was a groundwater or a surface
water location. The names of the locations are fairly random and basic
locality indicators, which cannot be interpreted exactly.

The data for each location consist of up to six variables which were
measured in the field (Table \ref{tab:TableMeasurements}). These were
complemented by laboratory analysis, which repeated some of the field
measurements, and for additional major anion and cation variables (Ca,
Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO\textsubscript{4}, HCO\textsubscript{3}), and total
Nitrogen (N) and total Phosphorus (P) for part of the sample set. Some
other variables were infrequently measured and are not included in the
data set.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:TableMeasurements}Variables measured in the field and laboratory}

\begin{tabular}[t]{l|l|l|l|l}
\hline

\hline
Dissolved Oxygen (DO) &  &  &  & \\
\hline
Turbidity &  &  &  & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The variables pH, EC, SPC (specific conductance: field temperature
corrected EC), Temperature, and in some cases DO and Turbidity were
measured using a range of field probes. All field probes measured pH,
EC, Temperature and calculated SPC. Early measurements (Samples up to
November 2014) used a YSI probe that included a turbidity and DO probe
(YSI 6600 and YSI 600 for surface and groundwater, respectively). Later
groundwater samples (After November 2014) used a different YSI probe
(YSI ProPlus multi-parameter) that only included a DO probe. Finally,
(After mid 2019) surface water and groundwater sampling used a Xylem Exo
probe with DO, pH, EC, Temperature and SPC. Some of the variability in
the field measurements might be due to this variation in the field
instrumentation, because the exact instrument information was not
recorded with the data.

Anions in most of the samples were analysed using high-performance
liquid chromatography method (Dionex P680 HPLC) and cations were
measured on acidified samples using an Inductively Coupled Plasma
Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, Varian 720-ES) at the University
of Sydney \citep{Akter2018}. Duplicate samples in the analysis had a
reported relative percentage difference (RPD) lower than 5\% in part of
the sample dataset \citep{Akter2018}. Some of the later samples and the
student sample set (Source 3) were analysed by a commercial laboratory
(\href{https://www.alsglobal.com/en/locations/asia-pacific/pacific/australia/nsw/sydney-woodpark-environmental}{ALS
Environmental, Smithfield, NSW}). Alkalinity concentrations were
generally measured in the field within 24h of collection using a HACH
digital titrator (model 16900) \citep{Akter2018} up to 2017 and by the
commercial laboratory after this.

The hydrogeochemical data is stored on the University of Sydney
escholarship repository: \url{doi.org/10.25910/m0wp-8890}

\subsection{Continuous variables}

The logger data, which collected groundwater pressure levels at 15 min
and later at 2 hour intervals, were adjusted for the length of the cable
and the height of the standpipe above the ground level. They were
subsequently summarised to raw daily values using an R script
(\texttt{SummariseDailyData.R}), which is stored on the github
repository.

The loggers in the field were uncalibrated. Due to logger failures, gaps
occur in the daily data, followed by replacement of the faulty loggers.
In some cases the cable length was adjusted and this was recorded in the
field notes. Overall, this resulted in data with gaps and sometimes odd
shifts in the recorded data.

Manual water level measurements were taken at each manual sampling date
to allow calibration of the logger data.

To correct the groundwater logger data, the daily data was matched to
the observed data using linear regression, if more than 3 manual
observed data were available and slope and intercept of the regression
had a p-value \textgreater{} 0.1. If there were less than 3 manual
observed data point for the specific logger an adjustment to the data
was based on the difference between the average observed data and the
average recorded water levels. Otherwise no adjustment was made. This is
slightly tricky: After the manual observations are made, the well is
purged and the logger is temporarily removed from the well. This data
(during the temporarily removal of the logger during the purging and
subsequent recovery of the groundwater level) is removed from the logger
data series. As a result, there is no direct time match between the
logger data series and the manual observations. However, the data showed
that, in most cases, the groundwater level recovered within 24 hrs.

To explain this more clearly the following pseudo code describes the
process:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Pseudo code cleaning groundwater level data}
\label{a1}
\begin{algorithmic}
\IF {sufficient points \> 3} 
        \STATE run a regression between interpolated depth and observed depth  
        \STATE check the p-values of the slope and intercept
        \IF {the slope is not significant (using p \> 0.10)}
                \STATE  use only the intercept to correct the logger data
        \ELSE
                \IF {the intercept is not significant, but the slope is}
                        \STATE use only the slope to correct the logger data
                \ELSE
                       \STATE use both slope and intercept of the regression to correct the logger data
                \ENDIF
        \ENDIF
\ELSE
        \STATE There are not enough values for a regression, use mean difference between logged and observed value to correct the logger data
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The code used to match the manually observed data with the logger data
is in the script \texttt{Match\_obs\_logger\_data.R}, which is stored
with the raw data in the Open Science Foundation (OSF) repository
associated with this paper \url{https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/BEUWK}.

After the automated process, two of the groundwater level data series
still had substantial discrepancies in some sections of the data. This
was most likely due to the a lack of observed data for the specific
logger. A final manual correction was applied. As this process is based
on judgement of the data by the authors of this paper, we documented
this in detail in the supplementary material.

The final corrected data that is published with this paper includes a
column which describes whether the data is based on the automatic
correction or a further manual correction.

\subsection{Boxplots and maps}

Using the most complete data, boxplots and spatial maps were generated
to highlight the spatial and temporal variation in the data set. We have
chosen to use boxplots to visually highlight statistical differences
between data variables rather than doing a full statistical analysis.

The mean concentration and interquartile range (25\textsuperscript{th} -
75\textsuperscript{th} percentile) of the concentration data
distributions were calculated to give an indication of variance of the
data in the spatial maps.

All graphs and maps were produced using R version 4.3.1 \citep{R2023}.
All code can be found in the associated
\href{https://github.com/WillemVervoort/MuttamaDataPaper}{github
repository}, as part of the markdown document for this paper.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Distribution of missing Values}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/na_GW} \caption{Percent missing values for the groundwater data across all piezometers.}\label{fig:gw-na-plot}
\end{figure}

In the hydrogeochemistry data, data source 3 was the most complete in
terms of variables analysed, because in this set more variables were
analysed in the commercial lab (Fig \ref{fig:na-plot}). Some of the
variables analysed in the commercial lab were not analysed with the
equipment at the University of Sydney. However, source 3 had the
smallest number of overall samples. Source 2 has the most incomplete
data points. Source 4 has a very consistent number of missing values,
possibly because not all samples were analysed in the set. For source 2,
the missing data suggests that for many of the samples only a few of the
variables were measured and analysed as highlighted above. In the data
from source 2, almost 50\% of samples are incomplete in terms of the
measurement of all the variables in Table 2. Similarly, source 1 had
more incomplete data, because some of the minor elements were not
analysed. The field recorded variables pH, EC, SPC and Temperature were
the most complete as they were generally measured directly in the field.
Thus the distribution of the NA values in the overall data set is mostly
a reflection of the time period of sampling and the change in
methodology over the ten years of sampling.

In the groundwater level time series, the missing data relate mostly to
logger failures and the different times that wells were instrumented.
Rather than giving a full breakdown by well location, the overall level
of completeness of the series is displayed (Fig \ref{fig:gw-na-plot}).

Groundwater samples have quite a distinctive hydrogeochemical signature
compared to the surface water samples (Fig \ref{fig:gw_sw-plot}). For
example, groundwater samples tend to be higher in EC and lower in pH
compared to surface water samples. Since `Source 1' collected most of
the groundwater samples, this results in differences between data
collection sources. Field SPC measurements were used to represent EC
since these samples had the best coverage.

\subsection{Temporal Distribution of Data}

\clearpage

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Figures/monthly} \caption{Distribution of samples throughout the year (total number of samples collected during each month) against average monthly rainfall during the study period. }\label{fig:month-plot}
\end{figure}

Overall the water quality sampling appears to have a reasonable
distribution across all months (Fig \ref{fig:month-plot}), so seasonal
trends should be identifiable in the data. Average rainfall data (1995 -
2022) does not indicate any major seasonal trends, although there is a
slight dominance of rainfall in the early Austral Spring (months 9 and
10, September and October). This also explains the higher number of
samples because, more sampling trips were organised in this period, and
spatially more channels could be sampled for surface water. The timing
of Source 3, (the student data) is a clear effect of yearly field trips,
which tended to occur at approximately the same time of the year in
early March and late September/early October, coninciding with the
University semesters.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Figures/annual} \caption{Distribution of samples over the study period (total number of samples collected during each year) against average monthly rainfall during the study period. }\label{fig:annual-plot}
\end{figure}

The number of samples collected in each year relative to the different
sources changes throughout the years reflecting the duration of the
different studies and funding cycles (Fig \ref{fig:annual-plot});
however the data is still well-distributed enough that overall trends
should be clear. In addition, some of the sample volumes can be related
to the occurrence of rainfall, as in drier years several of the channels
would be dry and no sampling of surface water could occur.

Consistent groundwater sampling commenced later in the project, which
means that there are very few groundwater samples before 2013. In
contrast, the autosamplers were installed early in the project and there
are no samples from this source after 2013.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/FDC} \caption{Sample distribution on flow duration curve derived from flow data from Coolac autosampler.}\label{fig:FDC}
\end{figure}

Surface water samples were reasonably well distributed across the flow
distribution, measured at the Coolac station (410044), with only a
possible bias towards periods of medium flow. This is most likely since
many of the upstream surface water sampling points are often completely
dry during periods of low flow at Coolac, and therefore cannot be
sampled. Conversely, there are no manual samples during high or very
high flow as during flood situations sampling was dangerous and
restricted by work health and safety considerations. The samples at high
flow are all from our automated sampling.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Figures/Final_Corrected_piezodepths} \caption{Overview of the corrected groundwater time series for all the wells}\label{fig:gw-series}
\end{figure}

The overall corrected groundwater timeseries shows the shorter time that
loggers were installed in the wells (\ref{fig:gw-series}). It also
indicates that the manual data is not always fully matched with the
logger data, but further corrections are likely to be speculation.

\subsection{Spatial variation}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/ec_map} \caption{Spatial Variation of EC throughout the catchment, using Mean EC in $\mu S/cm$ and interquartile range (IQR) for each sampling location. }\label{fig:ECmap}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/ec_plot} \caption{Variation in EC throughout the catchment across time by sample location presented as boxplots. The blue dashed line is the drinking water limit of 800 EC or 800 $\mu S/cm$.}\label{fig:ECboxplot}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/clhco3_map} \caption{Spatial Variation of $Cl:HCO_3$ ratio throughout the catchment, using Mean and interquartile range (IQR) for each sampling location.}\label{fig:Carbonate-map}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/clhco3_plot} \caption{Variation across time of the $Cl:HCO_3$ ratio by sampling location represented as a boxplot. The blue dashed line indicate a $Cl:HCO_3$ ratio of 1}\label{fig:Carbonate-boxplot}
\end{figure}

There is clear spatial variation in water parameters throughout the
catchment, including between groundwater and surface water sampling
sites (Figures \ref{fig:ECmap} and \ref{fig:Carbonate-map}). As
examples, the spatial distributions for EC and Cl:HCO\textsubscript{3}
are shown, as well as the space time boxplots for the variables. Similar
maps can be easily generated for other parameters. In the map, the
concentration is indicated by the size of the symbol, while the colour
shading indicates the variability. This suggests surface water samples
had lower variability and lower concentrations.

Below the maps, a boxplot (Figures \ref{fig:ECboxplot} and
\ref{fig:Carbonate-boxplot}) highlights the difference in the
distributions from the surface water sample sites and the groundwater
sample sites, and also indicates the difference between sample sites.

Previous studies have suggested there may be a difference in
Cl:HCO\textsubscript{3} ratio in surface water between the eastern and
western parts of the Muttama catchment \citep{Conyers2008}, and Figure
\ref{fig:Carbonate-map} suggest a similar pattern. A clearer picture is
limited by the spatial sampling, which relied on existing groundwater
tube wells and accessible stream points.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/piper_plot} \caption{Piper-plot of all groundwater and surface water data collected over the period}\label{fig:piperplot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Piper plot}

The piper plot of the data (\ref{fig:piperplot}) does not provide much
clarity as the samples cover a large area across the ternary space.
There is a slight shift towards the HCO\textsubscript{3} and Ca/Mg type
waters for the groundwater samples compared to the surface water
samples, which are more Na dominated. There is also a small cluster of
surface water samples that are more SO\textsubscript{4} dominated,
potentially indicating different geological origins as mentioned earlier
in the paper.

\section{Conclusions}

This paper reports on a long term (12 year) hydrogeochemistry dataset
from a single catchment in NSW, Australia. This dataset includes both
groundwater and surface water samples for 60 locations within the
catchment. While the dataset was collected by different groups of people
at different times and locations, it still provides a valuable long term
and spatially diverse data set which can be used for research into the
space and time variation of dryland and groundwater salinity.
